# Data Challenge -- Telcom Churn Prediction

## Objective
The main objective of this project is to predict which customers are likely to churn. By analyzing customer data, we aim to identify the attributes that contribute to customer churn.

## About the Dataset
Dataset of telecom customers for predicting customer churn. The dataset is available on Kaggle(https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/blastchar/telco-customer-churn) and comprises data on 5,986 customers.
### Context
"Predict behavior to retain customers. You can analyze all relevant customer data and develop focused customer retention programs." - IBM Sample Data Sets

###  Content
Each row in the dataset represents a customer, and each column contains customer attributes described in the column metadata. The dataset provides information about:

Customers who left within the last month (Churn column)
Services signed up by each customer, including phone, multiple lines, internet, online security, online backup, device protection, tech support, and streaming TV and movies
Customer account information, such as tenure, contract type, payment method, paperless billing, monthly charges, and total charges
Demographic information about customers, including gender, age range, and whether they have partners and dependents
Inspiration
The dataset offers an opportunity to explore predictive modeling for customer churn. By analyzing this data, you can gain insights into building models that predict customer behavior and contribute to customer retention strategies.
